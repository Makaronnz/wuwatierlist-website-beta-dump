The Resonator with this Echo equipped in the main slot gains 12.00% Electro DMG Bonus and 12.00% Basic Attack DMG Bonus. CD: 8s. If Twin Nova: Nebulous Cannon is equipped in another slot on the Resonator: Casting Echo Skill unleashes both Nebulous Cannon and Collapsar Blade skills in quick succession, but is still considered performing the same Echo Skill. DMG dealt by Twin Nova: Collapsar Blade becomes Spectro DMG. The Electro DMG Bonus gained from equipping it in the main slot is turned into Spectro DMG Bonus. Casting Basic Attacks grants 1 stack of Dyad Origins. Casting Resonance Skill grants 3 stacks of Dyad Origins. Dyad Origins can stack up to 6 times and lasts for 8s. Each stack increases Echo Skill DMG by 10%, and all stacks are cleared after this Echo Skill ends. This skill is capped at 2 uses. Initially, this skill can be used 2 times, with 1 use added every 8s.",
