The Resonator with this Echo equipped in the main slot gains 12.00% Spectro DMG Bonus and 12.00% Basic Attack DMG Bonus. CD: 8s. If Twin Nova: Collapsar Blade is equipped in another slot on the Resonator: Casting Echo Skill unleashes both Nebulous Cannon and Collapsar Blade skills in quick succession, but the DMG Bonus from the Echo in the main slot remains unchanged. DMG dealt by Twin Nova: Collapsar Blade becomes Spectro DMG. Casting Basic Attacks grants 1 stack of Dyad Origins. Casting Resonance Skill grants 3 stacks of Dyad Origins. Dyad Origins can stack up to 6 times and lasts for 8s. Each stack increases Echo Skill DMG by 10%, and all stacks are cleared after this Echo Skill ends. This skill is capped at 2 uses. Initially, this skill can be used 2 times, with 1 use added every 8s.",
